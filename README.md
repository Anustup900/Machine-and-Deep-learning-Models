# ABOUT THE PROJECT

These are some eaxmples of applications of prediction models by application of deep learnining and machine learning applications. 
The repo contains prediction examples based on job prediction.

Prediction of jobs based on different parameters like : Age , Location ,resume ,experience , skills,top skills , Profile based classification .

It speaks about the non-numeric classification and prediction also .

It implements:

1.) KNN 

2.) SVM

3.)Collaborative filtering (hybrid model of deep+ML)

2.)CNN model

3.)Conditional assesment Python 

# How to use the script :

-clone / git clone https://github.com/Anustup900/Machine-and-Deep-learning-Models.git

-run age prediction .py a simple python script with input of int value of graduation year

-get the out put of user age

-run skillbasedpred.py predicts landing industry of user based on input string input of skill

-run Recommender.py the recommendation model for similar user profile sharing based on input features by collaborative filtering

-run feature processing and pred by parameters and encoder models for support scripting
